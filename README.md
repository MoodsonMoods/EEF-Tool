# EEF Toolkit 2.0

## 🎉 EEF Tool v1.0 - Successfully Deployed!

Advanced analytics and planning tool for ESPN Eredivisie Fantasy (EEF) - built with Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS.

## 🎯 Overview

EEF Toolkit 2.0 provides FPL-level analytical and planning capabilities for the ESPN Eredivisie Fantasy league. It's designed as a desktop Next.js web application that serves pre-generated JSON datasets with an internally constructed normalized API.

## ✨ Features

### Core Features (v1)
- **Squad Planner**: Formation visualization with drag & drop, scenario save/load
- **Free Transfers System**: Complete transfer management with free transfers, saved transfers, and point penalties
- **FDR Analysis**: Attack & defence difficulty ratings with horizon rankings and flexible start gameweek selection
- **Price Change Monitor**: Track price movements and ownership changes
- **Player Analytics**: Enriched player tables with FBref integration
- **Localization**: Dutch and English language support

### Data Pipeline
- **Raw Ingestion**: Reverse-engineered ESPN EEF endpoints
- **Normalization**: Internal API with enriched player data
- **Static Delivery**: Pre-computed metrics for optimal performance
- **Data Integrity**: Manifest validation and freshness checks

### Free Transfers System
The squad planner now includes a comprehensive free transfers system that mirrors real EEF rules:

- **Unlimited Pre-Season**: Unlimited free transfers before gameweek 1 starts
- **Free Transfers**: 1 free transfer per gameweek (starting from gameweek 2)
- **Transfer Banking**: Save unused transfers for future gameweeks (max 5)
- **Point Penalties**: Extra transfers cost 4 points each
- **Transfer History**: Track all transfers with costs and timestamps
- **Gameweek Navigation**: Free transfers update automatically when changing gameweeks
- **Visual Indicators**: Clear display of available transfers and transfer costs

**Transfer Rules:**
- Users have unlimited free transfers before gameweek 1 starts
- Users get their first free transfer after gameweek 1 ends (before gameweek 2 starts)
- Unused transfers can be saved and carried forward
- Maximum of 5 free transfers can be accumulated
- Each extra transfer beyond free transfers costs 4 points
- Transfer history is maintained across all gameweeks

## 🏗️ Architecture

```
Raw Ingestion → Normalization → Type Generation + Build → Static Next.js App → Client Planner
```

### Data Flow
1. **Fetch Raw**: ESPN EEF endpoints via reverse engineering
2. **Normalize**: Transform to internal API format
3. **Enrich**: Merge with FBref data and price history
4. **Generate**: TypeScript types and static assets
5. **Serve**: Static Next.js app with client-side state management

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ 
- npm or yarn

### Installation

### Step 1: Data Pipeline ✅ COMPLETED

The data ingestion pipeline has been successfully implemented:

1. **Raw Data Ingestion** (`npm run ingest`)
   - Fetches data from ESPN EEF API (espngoal.nl)
   - Supports bootstrap-static, my-team, and account-info endpoints
   - Configurable via environment variables
   - Timestamped data storage

2. **Data Normalization** (`npm run normalize`)
   - Processes raw JSON into structured internal format
   - Normalizes teams, players, events, and game settings
   - Generates individual JSON files for each data type
   - Creates comprehensive normalized-data.json

3. **Type Generation** (`npm run generate-types`)
   - Auto-generates TypeScript types from normalized data
   - Creates comprehensive type definitions for all entities
   - Includes API response types and utility interfaces
   - Supports filtering, sorting, and pagination

4. **Internal API** 
   - RESTful API endpoints for players and teams
   - Advanced filtering and sorting capabilities
   - Pagination support
   - Error handling and validation

**Data Statistics:**
- ✅ 18 Teams (Ajax, AZ, Feyenoord, etc.)
- ✅ 505 Players across all positions
- ✅ 34 Gameweeks (Speelronde 1-34)
- ✅ Complete game settings and scoring rules
- ✅ Position types: GK (67), DEF (153), MID (226), FWD (59)

## 🛠️ Development

### Available Scripts

- `npm run dev` - Start development server
- `npm run build` - Build for production
- `npm run start` - Start production server
- `npm run lint` - Run ESLint
- `npm run type-check` - Run TypeScript type checking
- `npm run ingest` - Fetch raw ESPN data
- `npm run normalize` - Normalize raw data
- `npm run generate-types` - Generate TypeScript types

### Key Components

#### Formation Validator
Enforces positional constraints for valid XI + bench combinations:
- 1 GK (always)
- 3-5 DEF
- 3-5 MID  
- 1-3 FWD
- Total: 15 players (11 starting + 4 bench)

#### FDR Calculator
Computes fixture difficulty ratings using xG data:
- Attack FDR: How easy it is to score against opponent
- Defence FDR: How easy it is to keep clean sheet
- Horizon rankings: Aggregated difficulty over N gameweeks
- Flexible start gameweek: Analyze fixtures from any chosen gameweek (1-38)
- User preferences: Start gameweek selection is persisted in localStorage

#### State Management
Zustand store with three slices:
- **Preferences**: Language, theme, auto-save settings
- **Scenarios**: Squad scenarios with save/load/export
- **Planner**: Current formation, selected players, budget
